👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a fourth-year software development student with a strong interest in UX-focused web applications and full-stack engineering. I enjoy designing interfaces that are both visually engaging and technically sound, while also building the systems behind them.

My work combines front-end design, back-end logic, and database development, with an emphasis on usability, responsiveness, and clean architecture.

Currently contributing to SporeX, an AI-powered mobile application, where I focus on front-end development, UI/UX decisions, and agile team coordination.
